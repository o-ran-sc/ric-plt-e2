      "message": "Hi,\n\nHad a discussion with Thoralf on below points on e2mgr review request:\nhttps://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/c/ric-plt/e2mgr/+/11565\n\nWe can have following conditions\nFirst condition: if cuid and duid both are present, then consider it as GNB node\nSecond condition: if only cuid is present, then consider it as CU node\nThird condition: if only duid is present, then consider it as DU node\nFourth condition: if cuid and duid both are not present, then consider it as GNB node\n\nAlso there is a limitation on MEID length (32 bytes) (refer above discussion #78), considering which it seems it may not be possible to have both CUID and DUID appended in the RANname because of which we agreed on not appending cuid/duid in ranname in case both are present.\n\nPlease suggest if still cuid/duid needs to be appended in ranname if both are present. Accordingly the implementation needs to be updated in E2Manager and Rnib as well",
