      "message": "Hi,\n\nHad a discussion with Thoralf on below points on e2mgr review request:\nhttps://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/c/ric-plt/e2mgr/+/11565\n\nWe can have following conditions\nFirst condition: if cuid and duid both are present, then consider it as GNB node\nSecond condition: if only cuid is present, then consider it as CU node\nThird condition: if only duid is present, then consider it as DU node\nFourth condition: if cuid and duid both are not present, then consider it as GNB node\n\nAlso there is a limitation on MEID length (32 bytes) (refer above discussion #78), considering which it seems it may not be possible to have both CUID and DUID appended in the RANname because of which we agreed on not appending cuid/duid in ranname in case both are present.\n\nPlease suggest if still cuid/duid needs to be appended in ranname if both are present. Accordingly the implementation needs to be updated in E2Manager and Rnib as well",

      "message": "Sangama and I discussed this quickly and came to this conclusion. @gunja, what do you think?\n\nIt would be a very weird combination where CU-UP and DU ID are in the same E2 setup request (single E2 connection). There\u0027s a bit of information in TS 38.401 on this, but it leaves deployment options somewhat open. Also note that annex A.1 of the E2GAP spec - even if not an authoritative part of the spec - doesn\u0027t have this case either.\n\nMaybe we can add a comment in the source code that for now we do not support this kind of deployment and handle it as a \"gnb\", like:  \"Note that a deployment where CU-UP and DU are combined (but do not include the CP-CP) and have a single E2 connection is not supported. The combination of CU-CP, CU-UP, and DU we treat as a single gNB and expect it to have only the global gNB ID in its E2 Setup ID\"",
